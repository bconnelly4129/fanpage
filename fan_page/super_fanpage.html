<h2>Disney Truly is....</h2>
	<blockquote>"The Most Magical Place On Earth"-Walt Disney</blockquote>
<h1>The DO'S of Disney</h1>
	<ul>
	<li> <strong> DO</strong>-<em><strong>Stay at a Disney resort</strong></em></li> 
		<ul>
			<li>This will provied you with a full experince and can help you get little discounts in the park</li>
			<li>Sometimes the resort can get you extra park hours!</li>
		<li>The resorts also have fun activitiys for all ages!</li>
		</ul>
	<li><strong>DO</strong>-<em><strong>When staying at a Disney resort buy the disney fountain sovunier cups</strong></em></li>
		<ul>
		<li>They are around $20-$30 but you will get thursty so being able to fill up that cup anytime for no additonal charge is worth it</li>
		</ul>
		<li><strong>DO</strong>- <em><strong>Wear a watch that counts your steps</strong></em></li>
		<ul>
			<li>Some days you may be walking for 10 hours and that is usually around 20,000 steps. </li>
			<li>It is intresting to see how mnay steps you complete in a day or even your whole trip.</li>
		</ul>
		<li><strong>DO</strong>- <em><strong>Arrive early in the parks.</strong></em></li>
		<ul>
		<li>The lines and security checks are super long so the earlier you get the smaller the line and earlier you can get into the park</li>
			<li>Someimtes the park will open the gate early and if you are throguh security you can get a head start getting in line for the first ride</li>
		</ul>
		<li><strong>DO</strong>- <em><strong>Have the my Disney experaince app.</strong></em></li>
		<ul>
		<li>This app shows you all the wait times on the rides and if a ride is closed</li>
			<li> It also has maps of the park and what resturants and restrooms are near.</li>
		</ul>
		
	</ul>
<h1>The DON'TS of Disney</h1>
	<ul>
	<li><strong>DON'T</strong>-<em> <strong> forget your sneakers or comfortbale walking shoes</strong></em></li>
		<ul>
			<li>One time I forgot to bring sneakers and I had to walk around the park all day in crocs</li>
			<li></li>
			<p><img src="images/inside_out.jpg" width="180" height="242" alt=""/>
	      <strong>These are not comfortable shoes to walk in!! </strong> </p>
		</ul>
		<li><strong>DON'T</strong>- <em><strong>Make a dining reservation in Epcot</strong></em></li>
		<ul>
		<li>The best thing to do food wise in Epcot is to eat in diffretn countires and get snacks.</li>
			<li>There are many good meals, snacks, and desserts in every country in Epcot. You dont want to miss out!</li>
		</ul>
		<li><strong>DON'T</strong>-<em><strong>forget to bring water bottles with you in the park.</strong></em></li>
		<ul>
		<li>The water in the park is really expensive so if you have a water bottle with you, it could save you a lot of money.</li>
		</ul>
